# HSM Emulator
The `hsm-emulator` is a lightweight emulator that simulates the behavior of a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for
development and testing purposes.

## Overview
The HSM Emulator provides cryptographic operations such as key management between card and processor parties, enabling
developers to validate HSM-integrated workflows without requiring access to a physical HSM.

## Parties
The parties involved in the HSM emulator include:
- **ILF** - The ILF will be the activing ASE (Accont Serving Entity)
- **KaiOS** - The POS manufacturer
- **Austria Card** - The card issuer

## Build HSM Emulator:
The project is built as part of the Rafiki project.

## Start HSM Emulator
```shell
# Run (port 5002 default):
pnpm dev
```

## Key Management between Parties
The steps and digrams below illustrate the cryptographic keys and their relationship with one another and parties.

### 1.1. ZMK - Zone Master Key
The ZMK may be generated by either of two or more parties. One party is responsible for a ZMK key generation, while the 
other party is responsible for importing the ZMK. It is strongly advised that the ZMK be generated/imported using an HSM.
The KCV is used to verify integrity during the exchange.

    "Austria Card 💳" ||--|| "ZMK 🔑" : "imports (3x clear components)"
```

### 1.2. TMK - Terminal Master Key
The Terminal Master Key (TMK) is generated by the POS or terminal manufacturer and is unique to each terminal. 
It is securely transferred to the Account Serving Entity (ASE), 
encrypted under the Zone Master Key (ZMK) using the TR-31 key block format. 
The TMK facilitates the secure delivery of session keys between the ASE and the terminal, 
ensuring encrypted communication and key management.

    "ILF 🏦" ||--}| "TMK 🔑" : "imports (under ZMK)"
```

### 1.3. PIN/SRED BDK and IPEK - Base Derivation Key and Initial PIN Encryption Keys
The Base Derivation Keys (BDKs) are generated by the Account Serving Entity (ASE) and typically remain consistent for each terminal 
manufacturer or model. From the BDK, Initial PIN Encryption Keys (IPEKs) are derived and securely loaded onto the terminal, 
encrypted under the Terminal Master Key (TMK) using the TR-31 key block format. 
This process ensures secure delivery of keys to the terminal, either through direct injection or via an over-the-air Remote Key Injection (RKI) mechanism.

    "Terminal 📱" ||--|| "IPEK 🔑" : "imports (under TMK)"
```

### 2.1 Card Key - Card Asymmetric Keys
The Card Key Pair is generated by the Account Serving Entity (ASE), which also acts as the issuer. 
A unique key pair is created for each card. 
The private key from this pair is securely linked to a corresponding wallet address.
