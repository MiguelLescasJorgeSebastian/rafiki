Rafiki is a collection of three services that run together. Each one can be scaled horizontally.

- [backend](/services-and-aux-packages/backend-service) - The main service, responsible for handling business logic and external communication
- [auth](/services-and-aux-packages/auth-service) - A reference implementation of an Open Payments authorization server, used for grant authorization and authentication
- [frontend](/services-and-aux-packages/frontend-service) - An optional internal user interface, called the [Rafiki Admin](/resources/admin-user-guide), for you to manage your Rafiki instance

These services rely on four databases.

- A Postgres database used by the `backend` service for Open Payments resources
- A separate Postgres database used by the `auth` service for storing auth-related resources (grants, access tokens, and interactions)
- <LinkOut href='https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle'>

  , used by the `backend` service for accounting balances at the ILP layer
- Redis, used by the `backend` service as a cache to share STREAM connection details across processes and by the `auth` service to store session data

An additional package for [token introspection](/services-and-aux-packages/token-introspection) is also included with Rafiki. This is an internal package that requires no action on your part if you’re using Rafiki’s `auth` service.
