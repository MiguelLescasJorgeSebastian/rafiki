The Local Playground provides a suite of packages that, together, mock an account servicing entity that has deployed Rafiki. It exposes an <LinkOut href='https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/simple-payment-setup-protocol/'>SPSP</LinkOut> endpoint, the [Open Payments APIs](/components/open-payments) with its required <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol/'>GNAP</LinkOut> auth endpoints to request grants, a STREAM endpoint for receiving Interledger packets, and an admin UI to view and manage each Rafiki instance.

This suite of packages includes:

| Package name                                              | Services                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`backend`](/services-and-aux-packages/backend-service)   | <ul><li>SPSP</li><li>Open Payments APIs</li><li>GraphQL Admin APIs</li><li>STREAM endpoint</li></ul> |
| [`auth`](/services-and-aux-packages/auth-service)         | GNAP auth server                                                                                     |
| `mock-account-servicing-entity`                           | mocks an account servicing entity                                                                    |
| [`frontend`](/services-and-aux-packages/frontend-service) | Remix app to expose a UI for Rafiki admin management via interaction with the Backend Admin APIs     |

These packages depend on the following databases:

  alt='Databases required to run Rafiki'
  style='max-width:300px'
/>
| Database | Type | Function in Rafiki | |---|---|---| | TigerBeetle | High-performance
database designed specifically for double-entry accounting | Accounting (TigerBeetle
use is recommended over Postgres for accounting) | | Postgres | General purpose relational
database | Accounting (Postgres can be used instead of Tigerbeetle for accounting)
| | Postgres | General purpose relational database | Open Payments resources, auth
resources | | Redis | In-memory database | STREAM details, auth sessions |

The Local Playground comes with containerized versions of the Rafiki packages and two pre-configured docker-compose files (<LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml">Cloud Nine Wallet</LinkOut> and <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/happy-life-bank/docker-compose.yml'>Happy Life Bank</LinkOut>) to start two mock account servicing entities with their respective Rafiki `backend` and `auth` servers. They automatically peer, and two to three user accounts are created on both of them.

This environment will set up a playground where you can use the Rafiki Admin APIs and the Open Payments APIs.

:::note

The Mock ASE provided in this repository is intended solely for internal use and demonstration purposes. It is not designed to serve as a reference architecture. If you are looking for a reference implementation of an ASE, please refer to the Test Wallet.

## Running the local environment

To spin up the Local Playground install the following software on your machine:

- <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/README.md#environment-setup'>
    Rafiki local environment setup
  </LinkOut>{' '}
- <LinkOut href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/'>Docker</LinkOut>
- <LinkOut href='https://www.usebruno.com/downloads'>Bruno</LinkOut>, an
  open-source API client alternative to Postman

### Setup

Run the following commands from the root of the project.

<CodeBlock>

```
// If you have spun up the environment before, first tear down and remove volumes!

pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes

// Otherwise start the local environment
// start the local environment

pnpm localenv:compose up
```

</CodeBlock>

If you want to use Postgres as the accounting database instead of TigerBeetle, you must use the `psql` variant of the `localenv:compose` commands as follows:

<CodeBlock>

```
// If you have spun up the environment before, first tear down and remove volumes!  Otherwise start the local environment
pnpm localenv:compose:psql down --volumes


// start the local environment
pnpm localenv:compose:psql up
```

</CodeBlock>

The local environment consists of a primary and secondary Rafiki instance, each with its docker-compose file (<LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml'>Cloud Nine Wallet</LinkOut>, <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml'>Happy Life Bank</LinkOut>). The primary Cloud Nine Wallet docker-compose file (`./cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml`) includes the primary Rafiki `backend` and `auth` services, as well as the required data stores, which include TigerBeetle (if enabled), Redis, and Postgres. The primary instance contains all of the necessary components so that it can run independently.

The secondary Happy Life Bank docker-compose file (`./happy-life-bank/docker-compose.yml`) includes only the Rafiki services, not the data stores. It uses the data stores created by the primary Rafiki instance, so it can’t be run independently. The `pnpm localenv:compose up` command starts both the primary and secondary instances.

### Environment components

The following components are made available via the Local Playground:

### Exploring Accounts on Cloud Nine Wallet

Navigate to [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030/) to view the accounts on Cloud Nine Wallet.

:::note

The accounts for Happy Life Bank can be found on [localhost:3031](http://localhost:3031/).

:::

Click an account name to view a list of transactions.

### Debugging

Debuggers for the services are exposed on the following ports:

| Services                | IP and Port    |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Cloud Nine Backend      | 127.0.0.1:9229 |
| Cloud Nine Auth         | 127.0.0.1.9230 |
| Happy Life Bank Backend | 127.0.0.1:9231 |
| Happy Life Bank Auth    | 127.0.0.1:9232 |

#### Debugging with a Chromium browser:

1. Go to chrome://inspect

2. Click **Configure** and add the IP addresses and ports detailed above

3. Start the docker containers

4. Click**\* \*\*\***Inspect**\*** \*\*\*on the service you want to debug to open the Chromium debugger.

You can either trigger the debugger by adding `debugger` statements in the code and restarting the Docker containers or by adding breakpoints directly to the Chromium debugger after starting the Docker containers.

#### Debugging with VS Code:

To debug with VS Code, add this configuration to your `.vscode/launch.json`:

The` localRoot` variable will depend on the location of the `launch.json` file relative to Rafiki’s root directory.

For more ways to connect debuggers, refer to the Node JS docs for debugging: [https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging)

### Shutting down

To shut down your local instance, run the following commands:

| pnpm localenv:compose:psql build               | Build all the containers (with PostgreSQL)       |

### Known issues

#### No data in the mock account servicing entities

It is possible that upon starting or restarting the local playground, you may run into an issue where there are no accounts and wallet addresses in the mock account service entities’ pages on [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) and [http://localhost:3031](http://localhost:3031), respectively. You can only seed the initial account data against an empty database. To seed the database with this initial data, clear the existing volumes and restart the docker containers by issuing the following commands:

#### TigerBeetle container exists with code 137

There is a known issue when running TigerBeetle in Docker. The container exits without logs and simply shows error code 137. To fix this, increase the Docker memory limit. If you run the local Docker playground on a Windows machine via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can increase the memory limit by configuring your `.wslconfig` file.
