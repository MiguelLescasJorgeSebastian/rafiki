Rafiki is open-source software that allows Account Servicing Entities (ASEs) to enable Interledger functionality on its users’ accounts. It serves as a packaged solution for facilitating payments over the Interledger network.

Implementing the Interledger Protocol stack can be complex and challenging. Rafiki simplifies this process by providing a reference implementation, reducing development overhead for ASEs, and fostering broader adoption of Interledger technology.

## What Rafiki can help you do

- **Issue of payment pointers** - Rafiki facilitates creating and managing payment pointers, enabling users to send and receive payments over the Interledger network.
- **Facilitate Interledger payments** - Rafiki facilitates sending and receiving payments using the Interledger Protocol (ILP).
- **Enable third-party access** - Rafiki allows ASEs to authorize third-party access for initiating payments and managing transaction data using the Open Payments standard.

## What Rafiki is not

Rafiki distinguishes itself as open-source software deployed by ASEs, rather than a platform, service, library, or standalone wallet. It provides the underlying infrastructure for Interledger functionality.

:::caution
Rafiki is intended for use by Account Servicing Entities only and should not be used in production by non-regulated entities.

## Real-world usage examples

- **Peer-to-peer payments** - Rafiki enables seamless peer-to-peer payments, including cross-currency transactions. Users can transfer funds directly to each other’s accounts, regardless of their respective currencies, leveraging the interoperability of the Interledger network.
- **eCommerce payments** - Rafiki facilitates eCommerce transactions for both one-time purchases and recurring subscriptions. ASEs can integrate Rafiki into their platforms to offer customers flexible payment options and streamline the checkout process.
- **Web Monetization** - Websites can implement Web Monetization, a browser API that enables the streaming of payments directly from web site visitors to site owners. Rafiki provides support for Web Monetization payment flows right out of the box.

## Rafiki architecture

At its most basic level, Rafiki is comprised of the following three services:

- An authorization service that handles authorizing and authenticating incoming requests.
- A backend service that allows you to manage business logic, such as account management and balance tracking; facilitates third-party access to accounts via an Open Payments implementation; and simplifies peering with other nodes on the Interledger network.
- A front-end web application that allows Rafiki administrators to manage their Rafiki instance.
