---

For ease of reference, here is a list of things to check before you operate Rafiki in production and participate as a node on the Interledger network.

- [ ] Are you licensed as a financial entity (e.g. bank, fintech) in the jurisdiction that you are operating in?
- [ ] Have you set up of your Rates endpoint?
- [ ] Did you integrate your Rafiki instance with your Identity Provider (IDP) service and configure the user consent screen along with the interactoin flow?
- [ ] Have you selected a strategy to create wallet addresses for your account holders?
- [ ] Did you determine which enpoints to expose and how (nginx / apache / K8s)?
- [ ] Are your admin services secured from external access?
- [ ] Did you add at least one asset deploy-to-prod/running-your-instance/adding-asset either via the `backend` admin API or the Rafiki Admin application?
