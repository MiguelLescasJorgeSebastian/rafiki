Rafiki does not hold user account balances but tracks liquidity within asset, peer, and payment accounts in its own database. As an account servicing entity, you must manage this liquidity primarily in response to certain events dispatched from Rafiki. To receive these notifications from Rafiki, you must expose a webhook endpoint that listens for these events and reacts accordingly. When events fire in your Rafiki instance, the Rafiki `backend` service will make a POST request to the configured `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable and will expect a 200 status in the response.

### Request Body

Each webhook has the following structure in the request body:

| Variable Name | Type                          | Description         | Required |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `id`          | String                        | event ID            | Y        |
| `type`        | Enum: [EventType](#eventtype) | event type value    | Y        |
| `data`        | Object                        | any additional data | N        |

#### EventType

The following is an enumeration of all the event types along with their descriptions, which you must listen to and handle.

## Events

### `incoming_payment.created`

The `incoming_payment.created` event indicates that an incoming payment was created. No funds are received in your Rafiki instance, so no action is required. This webhook event is informational and allows you to display upcoming incoming payments to your users.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment created
    ASE->>ASE: no action required

`}
/>

### `incoming_payment.completed`

The `incoming_payment.completed` event indicates that an incoming payment was completed, either automatically or manually, and that any funds received into this incoming payment should be withdrawn and credited to the recipient’s account on your ledger.

In addition, the `CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal` supports two-phase transfers.

Example: An incoming payment was completed and the recipient received **$10**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment completed,<br>receivedAmount: $10
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $10

`}
/>

Example: An incoming payment supporting two-phase transfers was completed and received **$10**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

      R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment completed,<br>receivedAmount: $10
      ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal
      ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $10
      ASE->>R: admin API call: PostLiquidityWithdrawal
      R->>R: 2-phase transfer completed

`}
/>

### `incoming_payment.expired`

The `incoming_payment.expired` event indicates that an incoming payment has expired and that any funds previously received for this incoming payment should be withdrawn and credited to the recipient’s account on your ledger. Note that this event is only fired if funds were received for the incoming payment. In cases where the sender did not specify the `incomingAmount` when the `incomingPayment` resource was initially created, the `incoming_payment.expired` event notifies you that no further payments are expected. The primary use case of the `incoming_payment.expired` event to signal the end of any additional payments is a streaming payments example, such as <LinkOut href='https://webmonetization.org'>Web Monetization</LinkOut>.

Example: An incoming payment has expired and received **$2.55**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment expired,<br>receivedAmount: $2.55
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $2.55

`}
/>

### `outgoing_payment.created`

The `outgoing_payment.created` event indicates that an outgoing payment was created and is awaiting liquidity. You should verify the sender’s account balance and perform other verifications before funding or canceling the outgoing payment in case the sender has insufficient funds in their account. If the outgoing payment is not fulfilled, you can cancel it. Otherwise, you must put a hold on the sender’s account and deposit the funds into Rafiki.

Example: An outgoing payment for **&dollar;12** has been created.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki
    R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing payment created,<br>debitAmount: $12
    ASE->>ASE: check if account has enough balance
    alt Account has enough balance
    ASE->>ASE: put hold of $12 on sender's account
    ASE->>R: admin API call: DepositOutgoingPaymentLiquidity
    end
    alt Account does not have enough balance
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CancelOutgoingPayment<br>reason: Not enough balance
    end

`}
/>

### `outgoing_payment.completed`

The `outgoing_payment.completed` event indicates that an outgoing payment has successfully sent as many funds as possible to the receiver against the associated incoming payment. You should withdraw any excess liquidity from that outgoing payment in Rafiki that arises from differences between the sent and received amounts and use it as you see fit. One option would be to return it to the sender. Another option is to retain the excess liquidity as a service fee. Furthermore, you should remove the hold on the sender’s account and debit it.

In addition, the `CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal` supports [two-phase transfers](https://rafiki.dev/reference/glossary/#two-phase-transfers).

Example: An outgoing payment amount for **&dollar;12** has been completed. **&dollar;11.50** were sent. You keep **$0.50** as fees.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing completed,<br>debitAmount: $12, sentAmount:$11.50
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: remove the hold and deduct $12 from the sender's account,<br>credit ASE's account with $0.50

`}
/>

Example: An outgoing payment supporting two-phase transfers for **&dollar;12** has been completed. **&dollar;11.50** were sent. You keep **$0.50** as fees.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

        R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing completed,<br>debitAmount: $12, sentAmount:$11.50
        ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal
        ASE->>ASE: remove the hold and deduct $12 from the sender's account,<br>credit ASE's account with $0.50
        ASE->>R: admin API call: PostLiquidityWithdrawal
        R->>R: 2-phase transfer completed

`}
/>

### `outgoing_payment.failed`

The `outgoing_payment.failed` event indicates that an outgoing payment has either partially or completely failed and a retry was unsuccessful. You should withdraw any remaining liquidity from that outgoing payment in Rafiki. If the payment failed completely (the `sentAmount` was 0), you should remove the hold from the sender’s account. If the payment failed partially, you should remove the hold from the sender’s account and debit it with the amount sent. Considering the discrepancy between the quote amount and the amount sent, you should refrain from taking a sending fee.

Example: An outgoing payment for **&dollar;12** has failed. **$8** were sent.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing failed,<br>debitAmount: $12, sentAmount:$8
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: remove the hold and deduct $8 from the sender's account

`}
/>

### `wallet_address.web_monetization`

The `wallet_address.web_monetization` event indicates that a wallet address received Web Monetization payments via the ILP STREAM protocol. You should withdraw that liquidity from the wallet address in Rafiki and credit the receiver’s account on your ledger.

Example: A wallet address received **$0.33**

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: wallet address web monetization,<br>receivedAmount: $0.33
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateWalletAddressWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $0.33

`}
/>

### `wallet_address.not_found`

The `wallet_address.not_found` event indicates that a wallet address was requested via the Open Payments Wallet address server API, but it doesn’t exist in your Rafiki instance. When receiving this event, you can look up the associated account in your system and create a wallet address. The initial request for the wallet address will succeed if you create it within the configured `WALLET_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_MS` time frame.

Example: The wallet address `https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia` was requested but does not exist yet.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: wallet address not found,<br>wallet address: https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateWalletAddress<br>url: https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia,<br>public name: Carla Eva Garcia

`}
/>

### `asset.liquidity_low`

The `asset.liquidity_low` event indicates that an asset’s liquidity has dropped below a predefined liquidity threshold. When receiving this event, you should check if you already have or can acquire additional liquidity for that specific asset and, if so, deposit it in Rafiki. Cross-currency transfers will fail if you do not increase that asset’s liquidity in Rafiki.

Example: The asset liquidity for USD (scale: 2) drops below **$100.00**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: liquidity (asset) low,<br>asset: USD (scale: 2, id: "abc")
    ASE->>R: admin API call: DepositAssetLiquidity

`}
/>

### `peer.liquidity_low`

The `peer.liquidity_low` event indicates that a peer’s liquidity has dropped below a predefined liquidity threshold. When receiving this event, you must decide if you want to extend that peer’s credit line or whether the peer must settle first and then extend a new line of credit to that peer. If you cannot or do not increase the peer liquidity in Rafiki, transfers to that peer will fail.

Example: The peer liquidity for Happy Life Bank drops below **$100.00**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: liquidity (peer) low,<br>peer: Happy Life Bank (asset: "USD", scale: 2, id: "abc")
    ASE->>R: admin API call: DepositPeerLiquidity

`}
/>

## Errors

If an error occurs when Rafiki sends a webhook event (i.e., a non-200 status is returned or the request timed out), Rafiki will retry the webhook requests at increasing intervals until a 200 status is returned. The first retry is after 10 seconds, the second after 20 more, the next after 30 more, etc. The maximum number of retries for webhook events is configured via the WEBHOOK_MAX_RETRY environment variable.

Additionally, the timeout for webhook requests is configured with the `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

## Best Practices

### Duplicate Events

The `id` in the webhook event payload is a unique UUID, which your system can use to determine whether the event has been received previously, preventing duplicate event processing.

### Asynchronous Handling

Consider using a worker to process received webhook events, especially if requests to credit/debit user accounts are lengthy processes. Doing so allows the server to process events at a rate suitable for the system and reduce the number of failed/retried webhook events since the webhook event listener can immediately reply with a successful 200 status.
