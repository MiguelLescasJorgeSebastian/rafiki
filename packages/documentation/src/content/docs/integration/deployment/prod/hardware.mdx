title: Hardware & system requirements
---

Minimum software version requirements?
- the docs should tell a person where to get the latest release of Rafiki
--- does a Rafiki release ship with a readme, docs, a manual or if it just works (i.e. provides what you need)
--- when I receive a Rafiki release, what do I do?

- rm happy life bank and cloud 9 bank sections from the Prod section of the deployment docs
- check with Devs that a Rafiki ships with all of its software dependencies...such that we don't need to mention Postgres or Redis specifically (unless there's something that we want the audience to be aware of, or to do)
