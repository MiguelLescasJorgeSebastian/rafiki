title: Exchange rates

Every Interledger payment is preceded by a rate probe. A rate probe provides a quote that estimates the cost of transferring value over the network, including any fees connector nodes may charge. For a rate probe to be successful, Rafiki needs current exchange rates.

## Specify your exchange rates endpoint

Rafiki fetches exchange rates from your exchange rates endpoint. Set your endpoint via the `backend` service's `EXCHAGE_RATES_URL` variable. An <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/packages/backend/src/openapi/specs/exchange-rates.yaml">OpenAPI specification</LinkOut> for the endpoint is available.

<CodeBlock title='Example'>
  ``` EXCHANGE_RATES_URL: http://cloud-nine-wallet/rates ```
</CodeBlock>

The endpoint must accept <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/> requests and respond as follows.

<CodeBlock title='Example API request'>
  ``` GET https://cloud-nine-wallet/rates ```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="Example API response">
```
{
    "base": "USD",
    "rates": {
        "EUR": 0.813399,
    }
}
```
</CodeBlock>

### Response objects

| Variable             | Type   | Description                                                                                                                        | Required |
| -------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `base`               | String | The asset code represented as an <LinkOut href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO 4217</LinkOut> currency code, e.g. USD | Y        |
| `rates`              | Object | Object containing `<asset_code : exchange_rate>` pairs, e.g. `{EUR: 0.8930}`                                                       | Y        |
| `rates.<asset_code>` | Number | The exchange rate given `base` and `<asset_code>`                                                                                  | Y        |

## Specify rate caching duration (optional)

Specify how long your Rafiki instance will cache exchange rates via the `backend` service's `EXCHANGE_RATES_LIFETIME` variable or use the default setting of `15_000` ms (15 seconds).

Caching improves performance as Rafiki will not need to request the rates from your endpoint for every payment.

<CodeBlock title='Example'>``` EXCHANGE_RATES_LIFETIME: 20_000 ```</CodeBlock>

## Specify slippage (optional)

As exchange rates and fees charged by connectors fluctuate, there will likely be a variance between the estimated amount provided in the quote and the actual amount required when the payment is initiated. This difference is called slippage.

Set your allowed slippage rate to a value between 0 and 1 via the `backend` service's `SLIPPAGE` variable or use the default setting of `0.01` (1%).

<CodeBlock title='Example'>``` SLIPPAGE: 0.05 ```</CodeBlock>

### Example

Let's assume your Rafiki instance is using the default slippage of `0.01` (1%). The rate probe that precedes a USD payment returns a quote of `$1.00`. One percent of one dollar equals one cent.

If the total of the payment, inclusive of currency exchange rates and network fees, amounts to `$1.01`, the payment will be successful. If the total is `$1.02` or more, the payment will fail.

Below is a minimalistic example of a successful (200) response.

```json
export function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const base = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get('base') || 'USD'

  return json(
    {
      base,
      rates: config.seed.rates[base] || {}
    },
    { status: 200 }
  )
}
```

## Exchange rate environment variables

The exchange rate environment variables are part of the `backend` service.

The file that contains your variables varies depending on whether you are running Rafiki via Docker (`docker-compose.yaml`) or via Helm and Kubernetes (`values.yaml` for the Helm chart).

| Environment variable      | Description                                                                                     | Required |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `EXCHANGE_RATES_URL`      | Your exchange rates endpoint                                                                    | Y        |
| `EXCHANGE_RATES_LIFETIME` | The amount of time Rafiki caches exchange rates, in ms                                          | Y        |
| `SLIPPAGE`                | The variance allowed between a quote and the actual amount required when a payment is initiated | Y        |
