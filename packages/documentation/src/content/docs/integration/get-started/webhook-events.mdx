The main communication channel between you and your Rafiki instance is composed of the Backend Admin API and a set of webhook events.

Most events require you to interact with Rafiki to provide wallet address information or manage (deposit or withdraw) liquidity. Instead of holding user account balances, Rafiki keeps track of liquidity within your instance's asset, peer, and payment accounts within its own database.

## Specify your webhook event endpoint

First, specify your webhook endpoint via the `backend` service's WEBHOOK_URL variable. This endpoint is the URL to which your `backend` service will makes a <Badge text="POST" variant="success" size="medium"/> request when an event occurs. The `backend` service expects a `200` status in the response to confirm a successful receipt.

<CodeBlock title='Example'>
  ``` WEBHOOK_URL: http://cloud-nine-wallet/webhooks ```
</CodeBlock>

## Set up your event listener







"The following is an enumeration of all the event types along with their descriptions, which you must listen to and handle."



For Rafiki to notify you about webhook events, you must expose a webhook endpoint that listens for the events dispatched by Rafiki and reacts accordingly. These events notify your system of time-sensitive status updates, warnings, and errors.

Your expected behavior when observing the webhook events is detailed below.

## Request body

Each webhook event is sent as a JSON payload that follows a similar format. The parameters within the `data` object will vary depending on the event.

| Attribute | Type                      | Description                                         | Required |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `id`      | String                    | Unique webhook event ID                             | Y         |
| `type`    | [EventType](#event-types) | `EventType` value                                   | Y         |
| `data`    | Object                    | Additional data that coincides with the `EventType` | Y         |

## Error handling

If an error occurs when Rafiki sends a webhook event (i.e., a non-200 status is returned or the request timed out), Rafiki will retry the webhook requests at increasing intervals until a 200 status is returned. The first retry is after 10 seconds, the second after 20 more, the next after 30 more, etc. The maximum number of retries for webhook events is configured via the `WEBHOOK_MAX_RETRY` environment variable.

Additionally, the timeout for webhook requests is configured with the `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

## Incoming payment event sequence

### Incoming payment created

The `incoming_payment.created` event tells you when an incoming payment is created. This event is purely informational because, at this point, the incoming payment has not received any funds and no actions around liquidity are required. You can use this event to display upcoming incoming payments to your users.

The incoming payment will either complete or expire.

### Incoming payment completed

The `incoming_payment.completed` event indicates the payment completed either automatically or manually, and that any funds received into the incoming payment should be withdrawn and then credited to the recipient's account on your ledger.

Two `incoming_payment.completed` events are shown in the diagram below. The first is for a one-phase transfer and the second is for a two-phase transfer. In both examples, the recipient is credited with \$10.

### Incoming payment expired

The `incoming_payment.expired` event will only fire if funds were received for the incoming payment. The event signals the end of any additional payments.

The primary use case for this event is to know when a streaming payment, such as one supported through <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org">Web Monetization</LinkOut>, has expired. In response to the event, any funds already received for the payment should be withdrawn and credited to the recipient's account on your ledger.

:::note
In a scenario where a sender didn't specify an `incomingAmount` when the incoming payment was first created, receiving an `incoming_payment.expired` event indicates that no further payments are expected.
:::

In the diagram below, \$2.55 was received before the payment expired and the recipient is credited with that amount.

## Outgoing payment event sequence

### Outgoing payment created

The `outgoing_payment.created` event tells you when an outgoing payment is created and is awaiting liquidity. Verify the sender's account balance and perform any other necessary verifications before funding the payment. 

If the sender has insufficient funds or should otherwise not be fulfilled, cancel the outgoing payment.Otherwise, put a hold on the sender's account and deposit the funds into Rafiki.

### Outgoing payment completed

The `outgoing.payment_completed` event indicates that as much as possible has been sent to the receiver against their incoming payment. 

If there is excess liquidity in Rafiki due to differences between the sent and received amounts, withdraw the excess from the outgoing payment. What you choose to do with the excess is a business decision. One option is to return the excess to the sender. Another option is to retain the excess as a service fee. Lastly, remove the hold on your sender's account and debit their account on your ledger.

Two `outgoing.payment_completed` events are shown in the diagram below. The first is for a one-phase transfer and the second is for a two-phase transfer. In both examples, the outgoing payment amount is \$12 and you choose to keep the \$0.50 in excess liquidity as a service fee.

### Outgoing payment failed

The `outgoing_payment.failed` event indicates that an outgoing payment has either partially or completely failed and a retry was unsuccessful. Withdraw any remaining liquidity from the outgoing payment in Rafiki. If the payment failed completely (the `sentAmount` is `0`), remove the hold from your sender's account. If the payment partially failed, remove the hold from your sender's account, then debit the sender's account on your ledger with the amount that was sent successfully. Since there will be a discrepancy between the quote amount and the sent amount, we suggest you refrain from taking a sending fee.

## Wallet address event sequences

### Wallet address received Web Monetization payments

The `wallet_address.web_monetization` event indicates that a wallet address received Web Monetization payments via the ILP STREAM protocol. Withdraw the liquidity from the wallet address in Rafiki and credit the receiver’s account on your ledger.

In the sequence diagram below, a wallet address on your Rafiki instance received $0.33.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account servicing entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: Webhook event: wallet address Web Monetization,<br>receivedAmount: $0.33
    ASE->>R: Backend Admin API call: CreateWalletAddressWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $0.33

`}
/>

### Wallet address not found

The `wallet_address.not_found` event indicates that a wallet address was requested by a peer via the Open Payments Wallet address server API, but the address doesn’t exist in your Rafiki instance. 

If you receive this event, you can look up the associated account in your system and create a wallet address for the account. The initial wallet address request will succeed if you create it within your configured `WALLET_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_MS` time frame.

<CodeBlock title='Example'>
  ``` WALLET_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_MS:  ```
</CodeBlock>

The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the wallet address `https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia` was requested from your Rafiki instance, but the address does not exist yet.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account servicing entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: Webhook event: wallet address not found,<br>wallet address: https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia
    ASE->>R: Backend Admin API call: CreateWalletAddress<br>url: https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia,<br>public name: Carla Eva Garcia

`}
/>

## Low asset liquidity event sequence

The `asset.liquidity_low` event indicates that an asset's liquidity has dropped below your predefined liquidity threshold. Check if you already have, or can acquire, additional liquidity for that specific asset. If so, deposit it in Rafiki. Cross-currency transfers will fail if you don't increase the asset's liquidity.

## Low peer liquidity event sequence

The `peer.liquidity_low` event indicates that a peer's liquidity has dropped below your predefined liquidity threshold. Decide whether you want to extend the peer's credit line or if your peer must settle before you will extend a new line of credit. If you cannot or do not increase the peer liquidity in Rafiki, transfers to that peer will fail.

## Wallet address event attributes

## Asset liquidity low event attributes

## Peer liquidity low event attributes

## Best practices

### Duplicate events

The `id` in the webhook event payload is a unique UUID, which your system can use to determine whether the event has been received previously, preventing duplicate event processing.

### Asynchronous handling

Consider using a worker to process received webhook events, especially if requests to credit/debit user accounts are lengthy processes. Doing so allows the server to process events at a rate suitable for the system and reduce the number of failed/retried webhook events since the webhook event listener can immediately reply with a successful `200` status.

An OpenAPI specification of the webhook requests and their corresponding data can be found <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/packages/backend/src/openapi/specs/webhooks.yaml'>here</LinkOut>.

Additionally, the local playground playground contains example payloads in the Bruno collection that can be used to test a webhook service integration.
