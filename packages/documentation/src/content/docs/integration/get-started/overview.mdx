Before you begin setting up your production environment, consider the following.

## Webhook events

The main communication channel between you and your Rafiki instance is composed of the Backend Admin API and a set of webhook events. Most of these events require you to interact with Rafiki. The [Webhook events](/integration/get-started/webhook-events) page describes each event and explains the action you're expected to take when a particular event fires.

## Identity provider (IdP)

An identity provider (IdP) is a system or service that stores and manages user identity information, authentication, and consent. Examples of IdPs include OpenID Connect and Okta.

Since Rafiki requires Open Payments, Rafiki also requires that you integrate with an IdP. The [`auth`](/integration/services/auth-service) service includes support for such integration. Visit the [Identity provider (IdP)](/integration/get-started/idp) page for more integration details.

Part of the Open Payments standard states that outgoing payment grant request must be interactive. In an interactive grant request, explicit interaction by an individual (e.g., an account holder) is required to approve a grant. A common example of this from the perspective of a mobile app user is being asked to authenticate (sign in) and then consent (approve) to some action.

## Exchange rates

To support cross-currency transactions, you must specify from where your Rafiki instance will fetch current [exchange rates](/integration/get-started/exchange-rates). Exchange rates are calculated as part of a payment's quote, which estimates the full cost of transferring value over the network.

## Fees

You have the option to charge fees on top of estimated network fees to facilitate transfers. Each asset you support can have a different fee structure. Visit the [Fees](/integration/get-started/fees) page for details.
