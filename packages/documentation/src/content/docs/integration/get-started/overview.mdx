As you begin setting up your production environment, there are a few integration details that should be approached first. Begin by configuring Rafiki to:

- Support cross-currency transactions by providing [exchange rate details](/integration/get-started/exchange-rates)
- Charge [fees](/integration/get-started/fees) for facilitating transfers
- Integrate with your [identity provider](/integration/get-started/idp)
- Establish a mechanism for managing liquidity via [webhook events](/integration/get-started/webhook-events)
