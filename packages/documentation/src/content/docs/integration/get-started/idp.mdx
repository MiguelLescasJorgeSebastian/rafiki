An identity provider (IdP) is a system or service that stores and manages user identity information, authentication, and consent. Examples of IdPs include OpenID Connect and Okta.

Since Rafiki requires Open Payments, Rafiki also requires that you integrate with an IdP. The purpose of the IdP is to:

- Authenticate requests from clients, such as mobile apps, to create quotes and payments on Rafiki's backend
- Facilitate interactions with resource owners, such as your account holders, to gather consent

## Facilitating interactions

Before a client can make an outgoing payment request, it must obtain a grant from your authorization server. 

auth
service provides you with a reference implementation of an Open Payments authorization server. You can use the auth service as an alternative to developing your own in-house service for grant authorization and authentication.



 Open Payments requires explicit interaction by an individual (typically the client's end user) before issuing the grant. Presenting the end-user with a consent screen from which they choose to accept or deny the payment is an example of an interaction.

The interaction is facilitated by your IdP. Your IdP:

- Provides the consent screen
- Sends the user's interaction choice to your authorization server
- Redirects the user after the interaction is complete




-----

The auth service includes support for such integration.

Part of the Open Payments standard states that outgoing payment grant request must be interactive. In an interactive grant request, explicit interaction by an individual (e.g., an account holder) is required to approve a grant. A common example of this from the perspective of a mobile app user is being asked to authenticate (sign in) and then consent (approve) to some action.

## Integrate with your identity provider




### Rafiki Admin

Rafiki Admin is a web app that allows you to manage your Rafiki instance through a UI. Out of the box, we provide Ory Kratos for the identity and user management of your administrators. Kratos is for internal use and cannot be used as an identity provider for your Open Payments authorization server.

### IdP environment variables

| Environment variable     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Required |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `IDENTITY_SERVER_DOMAIN` | The URL that your authorization server will direct the client to so the client's end-user can complete the interaction and authorize a grant.                                                                                      | Y        |
| `IDENTITY_SERVER_SECRET` | A shared secret between your authorization server and your IdP that your authorization server will use to secure its IdP-related endpoints. Your IdP must provide this secret when it sends requests to your authorization server. | Y        |

### Endpoints

There are a number of endpoints that facilitate communication between your IdP and your authorization server after a pending grant request is created.

The endpoints are called in the sequence listed in the table below.

| Method                                               | Endpoint                        | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/>     | `/interact/:id /:nonce`         | [Establish interaction session](#establish-interaction-session) |
| <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/>     | `/grant/:id /:nonce`            | [Fetch grant information](#fetch-grant-information)             |
| <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/>     | `/grant/:id /:nonce`            | [Accept or reject grant](#accept-or-reject-grant)               |
| <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/>     | `/interact/:id /:nonce /finish` | [Finish interaction](#finish-interaction)                       |
| <Badge text="POST" variant="success" size="medium"/> | `/interact/:id /:nonce`         | [Continue grant](#continue-grant)                               |

Each interaction with an endpoint is identified by an `id` and a `nonce`. Both are provided as query parameters when your authorization server redirects to your IdP.

#### Establish interaction session

Called by the client and establishes an interactive session with your authorization server, which redirects the browser session to the IdP consent screen.

#### Fetch grant information

Called by your IdP to retrieve a list of access rights, requested by the client, from your authorization server. The access rights are presented to the client's end-user on the consent screen. The authorization server's response is served on the `INTERACTION_PORT`, which is `3009` by default.

| Header         | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Required |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `x-idp-secret` | Used to secure communication between your IdP and authorization server using the shared secret defined in the `IDENTITY_SERVER_SECRET` environment variable. | Y        |

#### Accept or reject grant

Your IdP communicates the end-userâ€™s acceptance or rejection on the consent screen to your authorization server, then redirects to `GET /interact/:id/:nonce/finish`. The response is served on `INTERACTION_PORT`, which is `3009` by default.

| Header         | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Required |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `x-idp-secret` | Used to secure communication between your IdP and authorization server using the shared secret defined in the `IDENTITY_SERVER_SECRET` environment variable. | Y        |

#### Finish interaction

Your IdP ends the interaction initiated by `GET /interact/:id/:nonce` and redirects the end-user's browser session to the URI of the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/">grant initialization request</LinkOut>. A query parameter will indicate a failure, or on success, a SHA-256 hash parameter that the client can use to verify the successful interaction.

| Query parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Required |

| `nonce`         | Interaction nonce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Y        |
| `result`        | Success or failure of the grant authorization. In case of success, the SHA-256 hash of the interaction is sent in the response along with the `interact_ref` that identifies the interaction on the authorization server and the URI of the grant initialization request. | Y        |

The following tables list examples of the different possible response types on this endpoint.

#### Continue grant

The client requests a grant from your authorization server for an accepted interaction. Your authorization server responds with an <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue/">access token</LinkOut>.
