The Rafiki Admin application provides tools to manage peers, assets, wallet addresses, webhooks, payments, and account settings. The purpose of this document is to help you navigate and use the Rafiki Admin application effectively.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with general Rafiki concepts. The [Rafiki overview](/overview/overview) is a great place to start.
- Rafiki Admin login credentials

## Navigation

After logging in, you’ll be greeted by the main landing page with a left-hand navigation menu. This menu provides access to all of the main functionality needed to manage your Rafiki instance.

  alt='Rafiki Admin application user interface welcome screen with navigation options like Home, Peers, Assets, Wallet Addresses, Webhooks, and more on the left sidebar.'
  class='img-outline'
/>

Each of the following menu items leads to a different page of the Rafiki Admin application:

- [Peers](#peers)
- [Assets](#assets)
- [Wallet addresses](#wallet-addresses)
- [Webhooks](#webhooks)
- [Payments](#payments)
- [Account settings](#account-settings)

## Peers

The Peers page allows you to manage peering relationships in your Rafiki instance, including viewing, creating, editing, and deleting peers.

On this page, all configured peers are displayed in a table where you can view the peer name, its ILP address, asset details including the asset type and scale, and the outgoing HTTP endpoint.

### Create peer

To create a new peer, select **Create Peer** from the main Peers page.

## Webhooks

The Webhook Events page allows you to monitor and manage webhook events within your Rafiki instance. Webhook events in Rafiki are the main communication channel between you and your Rafiki instance. See [Webhook events](/integration/before-you-begin#webhook-events) for more information about webhook events.

All webhook events that have been triggered are displayed in the table. For each webhook event, you can see the webhook ID, the event type, and the date and time of the event. There is also a field at the top of the page allowing you to filter the table by event type, making it easier to drill down into specific events.

The Payments page allows you to view all incoming and outgoing payments in your Rafiki instance. This allows you to monitor payment activity as well as track the status of payments.

All payments are displayed in the table. For each payment, you can view the unique payment ID, type of payment, state of the payment, and the date and time the payment was created. There is also a field at the top of the page allowing you to filter the table by payment type, making it easier to drill down into specific transactions.
