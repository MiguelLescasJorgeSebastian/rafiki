Rafiki is open-source software that is freely available to any licensed **account servicing entity** (ASE) that wants to implement [Interledger](#interledger) and [Open Payments](#open-payments) on its users' accounts.

Implementing and maintaining the Interledger Protocol (ILP) stack on your own can be difficult and time-consuming. Rafiki is maintained by a dedicated team, making it the perfect solution for ASEs who want to integrate with the Interledger network without developing and maintaining their own implementations.

<Card title='What is an account servicing entity?'>
  It's an entity that provides and maintains payment accounts for its customers
  and is regulated within the jurisdictions it operates. Examples of ASEs
  include banks, digital wallet providers, and mobile money providers. Rafiki
  should **not** be used in production by non-regulated entities. [Learn more

## Real-world use cases

### Peer-to-peer payments

Rafiki enables seamless peer-to-peer payments, including cross-currency transactions. Users can transfer funds directly to each otherâ€™s accounts, regardless of their respective currencies, leveraging the interoperability of the Interledger network.

### eCommerce payments

Rafiki facilitates eCommerce transactions for both one-time purchases and recurring subscriptions. ASEs can integrate Rafiki into their platforms to offer customers flexible payment options and streamline the checkout process.

### Web Monetization

Websites can implement Web Monetization, a browser API that enables the streaming of payments directly from web site visitors to site owners. Rafiki provides support for Web Monetization payment flows right out of the box.

## Interledger

The Interledger network is a network of nodes that have implemented the Interledger Protocol (ILP) stack. Rafiki is a reference implementation if the ILP stack, enabling you to more easily become a node on the network and start sending and receiving payments.

Interledger is designed to be a network on top of existing payment networks that serves as the interoperability layer between them all, forwarding payment messages (packets) while also taking care of currency conversion. Interledger ensures that packets take the fastest and cheapest route from one Interledger node to another.

## Open Payments

Open Payments is an API standard and set of open RESTful APIs that facilitate interoperability in the setup and completion of payments. The standard provides a uniform way to create and manage grants and resources for incoming payments, quotes, and outgoing payments.

By following the Open Payments standard, Rafiki allows your customers' accounts to become Open Payments-enabled. Clients, such as mobile apps, can then call the Open Payments APIs to securely retrieve transaction data and initiate payments from your customers' accounts with your customers' prior consent.

## More about account servicing entities (ASEs)

As regulated entities, ASEs are subject to the laws, rules, and regulations of their jurisdictions. As such, Rafiki should **not** be used in production environments by non-regulated entities.

Below are just a few examples of an ASE's responsibilities and obligations.

### Regulatory compliance

ASEs must onboarding account holders in compliance with regulatory requirements, such as performing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, anti-money laundering (AML) processes, and sanctions screening.

### Account provisioning and maintenance

ASEs manage the creation, upkeep, and security of payment accounts. This includes providing channels for account holders (individuals or businesses) to interact with their accounts via mobile apps, websites, and other interfaces.

### Transaction handling

ASEs handle deposits and withdrawals through various external payment methods such as bank transfers, credit cards, and other payment services.

### Ledger management

ASEs maintain a ledger of account balances and transaction histories for their account holders.

### Authentication and consent

In the context of Open Payments, ASEs are responsible for authenticating resource owners (e.g., account holders) and obtaining their consent when clients, such as mobile apps, request access to a resource (e.g., an account).
