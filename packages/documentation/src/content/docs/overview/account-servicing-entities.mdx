An Account Servicing Entity (ASE) is an organization that provides and maintains payment accounts for payers and payees. These payers and payees are regulated within the jurisdictions they operate and can include a variety of financial institutions such as banks, digital wallet providers, and mobile money providers.

Rafiki is software that removes the complexities of implementing the ILP stack. In this context, an ASE integrates Rafiki into their internal systems to enhance account features by enabling Interledger functionality on its usersâ€™ accounts. This integration allows ASEs to join the Interledger network efficiently and facilitates the seamless sending and receiving of payments.

## Key functions of ASEs

- **Regulatory compliance** - ASEs are responsible for onboarding account holders in compliance with regulatory requirements, such as performing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes, and sanctions screening.
- **Account provision and maintenance** - ASEs manage the creation, upkeep, and security of payment accounts. This includes providing channels for account holders (individuals or businesses) to interact with their accounts via mobile apps, websites, and other interfaces.
- **Transaction handling** - ASEs handle deposits and withdrawals through various external payment methods such as bank transfers, credit cards, and other payment services.
- **Ledger management** - ASEs maintain a ledger of account balances and transaction histories for their account holders.
- **Authentication and consent** - Using the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/introduction/overview/">Open Payments standard</LinkOut>, ASEs authenticate account holders and manage consents to grant secure access to their accounts.
- **API key management** - ASEs keep a record of the public keys used by account holders to access the Open Payments APIs, ensuring secure and authenticated transactions.

## Examples of ASEs

- **Banks** - Traditional financial institutions offering a wide range of payment services.
- **Digital wallets** - Software applications that store payment methods, card credentials, and personal information. A digital wallet is basically an electronic version of a physical wallet you would carry.
- **Mobile money** - Mobile payments system based on accounts held by a mobile operator and accessible from subscribers' mobile phones. The conversion of cash into electronic value (and vice versa) happens at retail stores (or agents). All transactions are authorized and recorded in real-time using SMS.
